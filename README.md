# Project Problem Statement
We would like to implement a program that mimics how processes are managed by the dispatcher in an OS. The high-level structure of the program is shown in Fig. 1 below. The program has to be developed in C programming language on a linux OS.



**Fig. 1 (High-level context)**


The program has the following main modules:

**Request listener**
It is a program which listens for incoming socket connections from clients. A client sends request messages to the request listener over the socket connections. The request message has the following structure:
```bash
struct request {
	char* dll_name; // Name of a dynamically loaded library
	char* func_name; // Name of a function to call from the DLL
	char** func_args; // Arguments to pass to the function
};
```

A request message represents a request to invoke a function from a dynamically loaded library.
On receiving a socket connection from a client, the listener spawns a new thread to handle the connection and the messages received via that connection. This allows the listener to handle multiple requests from clients without blocking. The request messages received over a socket connection will be stored in a request queue. The client is sent an acknowledgement on successfully enqueuing the request. The port number on which the listener listens should be supplied as a CLI argument to the program.

**Request queue**
It is an in-memory data structure which will hold the requests received by the request listener. It will be a bounded queue having a fixed maximum size, say 100.

**Dispatcher**
This is the main part of the whole program. Its main purpose is to take out request messages from the request queue, and then execute the function specified in the request message. The function has to be executed in a separate thread. There is only a fixed number (e.g., 8) of threads allowed to be used. Similarly, the amount of memory (e.g. 10MB) and the number of files (e.g. 10) that can be open at any point of time in these threads (taken together, not individually) are fixed. These numbers should be taken as CLI arguments when running the program.

The functions to be executed (i.e. the one specified in the request message) are to be loaded dynamically (see https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/dl-libraries.html).

**Dynamically loaded library (DLL) function invoker**
The functionality of DLL function invocation should be encapsulated in a module of its own for better understanding and maintainability. For testing the program, you should use one of the standard DLLs (e.g. the math library at /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6) available on a linux OS. 
 


# Multithreaded-Server-With-DLL-function-Calculators

* Start the Server in one terminal by the following commands in one terminal:
```bash
* gcc client_server_socket.c -lpthread -ldl -o ipc_demo

./ipc_demo server ./myserver
```

* After starting the server, Start the Client in other terminal by the following commands in one terminal:

```bash
gcc client_server_socket.c -lpthread -ldl -o ipc_demo


./ipc_demo client ./myserver "give_pathof_DLL_library name_of_function args_for_function"

eg. ./ipc_demo client ./myserver "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 cos 2.0"
```
 **give_pathof_DLL_library:** Any library path which you want to execute eg. "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6"

 **name_of_function:** name of the function in the DLL library supplied e.g. commands

 **args_for_function:** the positional arguments in specific order. Refer to the table provided below.

Library path                        |  Function Name            |  Arguements in order
------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6     | cos                       | One int type in range->cos(X) where X is the input
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6     | sin                       | One int type in range->sin(X) where X is the input
